        *   Option for background recording.
        *   Adjustable recording input levels (gain control).
    *   **Transcription:**
        *   Automatic voice-to-text transcription using a robust speech recognition engine.
        *   Support for multiple languages (initial launch with English, Spanish, French, German).
        *   Offline transcription capabilities (potentially with a smaller, less resource-intensive model).
        *   Timestamping of transcribed text.
        *   Display of transcription confidence levels (perhaps styled as "Signal Strength" or similar 80s-themed indicator).
    *   **Note Management:**
        *   Ability to title and tag notes.

        *   Pixelated font resembling classic computer terminals.
        *   Use of ASCII art and simple geometric shapes for UI elements.
        *   Sound effects reminiscent of 80s computers (e.g., beeps, boops, modem sounds).
        *   "Loading" animations that mimic old-school progress bars.
        *   A command-line-like interface element (optional) for advanced users, allowing for text-based commands (e.g., "LIST NOTES," "SEARCH KEYWORD," "PLAY [note title]").
    *   **Data Security and Privacy:**
        *   Local storage of recordings and transcriptions (by default).
        *   Optional cloud synchronization (with end-to-end encryption).
        *   Clear privacy policy and user consent for data processing.

        *   Option to export notes in various formats (e.g., TXT, DOC, PDF).
        *   Ability to share notes via email, messaging apps, or other standard sharing mechanisms.
        *   Perhaps a fun, 80s-themed sharing option like "Transmit via Modem" (which just uses standard sharing under the hood).
    *   **Settings/Customization:**
        *   Adjustable audio quality settings.
        *   Choice of transcription engine (if multiple are integrated).
        *   UI customization options (e.g., color scheme, font size).
